#example for 3 particle types:
#file name with tabulated potential between particle types 1 and 1
#file name with tabulated potential between particle types 1 and 2
#file name with tabulated potential between particle types 1 and 3
#file name with tabulated potential between particle types 2 and 2
#file name with tabulated potential between particle types 2 and 3
#file name with tabulated potential between particle types 3 and 3
#However, here we just use one particle type
